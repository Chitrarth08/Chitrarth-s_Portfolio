# **Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Airline Passenger Satisfaction**

This is a project that I did to gather and generate insights from an "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" DataSet.

* The data was taken from Kaggle.com
* The process includes Cleaning, Preprocessing followed by sorting of the Dataset containing various factors like Seat Comfort, In-Flight Service, Passenger Satisfaction etc. for further Visualization to extract Insights for further Improvements.
* Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook,Tableau.




# **Project 2: Currency Exchange Calculator(Data Scrapping)**

This is a mini project that I did to make a Currency Exchange Calculator that converts one currency amount into another based on Real time or Historical Data from Currency Data API.

* API data was pulled from apilayer.com.
* Tools Used: Python(Requests Library), Jupyter Notebook, Currency Data API(apilayer.com)




# **Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Loan Data**

This is a project that I did to clean and preprocess a "Loan" DataSet.

* The process includes Cleaning, Preprocessing followed by sorting of the Dataset containing various parameters like Issue Date,Loan Status,Term,Loan Amount,Funded Amount,Interst Rate etc. which could be used for further Visualization to extract Insights for further Improvements.
* Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas), Jupyter Notebook.




# **Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on Employee Dataset**

This is a project that I did to clean and preprocess an "Employee" DataSet.

* The process includes Cleaning, Preprocessing followed by sorting of the Dataset containing various parameters like Transportation Expense,Distance to Work,Education,Children,Absenteeism Time in Hours, etc. which could be used for further Visualization to extract Insights for further Improvements on How to reduce the Absenteenism among the Employees.
* Tools Used: Python (Numpy, Pandas), Jupyter Notebook.
